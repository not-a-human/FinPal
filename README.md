# FinPal

**FinPal** is a finance management app designed to help users plan allocated funds based on a percentage of their monthly salary. Users can create records for bills and loans, and the app notifies them when any bill or loan exceeds the allocated fund for the specified category. Additionally, users can track their monthly salary within the app. This project is still in the testing and development phase, and we welcome feedback from testers.
